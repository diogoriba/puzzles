party
=====

Story:
You need to help planning a company party. A representation of the company hierarchy is available in the `tree.json` file. Each node of the tree has a "coolness" ratio. The goal is to create a list of invitees with the largest "coolness" sum possible. The only limitation is: if employee X is invited, X's immediate boss cannot be invited as well.

Pick any language you want.
For additional complexity, add these limitations:
* There must be the same number of male and female invitees
* You can invite a maximum of 100 guests
